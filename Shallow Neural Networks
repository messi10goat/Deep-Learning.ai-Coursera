2.Question 2
The tanh activation usually works better than sigmoid activation function for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to zero, and so it centers the data better for the next layer. True/False?


True


False

Correct
Yes. As seen in lecture the output of the tanh is between -1 and 1, it thus centers the data which makes the learning simpler for the next layer.

4.Question 4
You are building a binary classifier for recognizing cucumbers (y=1) vs. watermelons (y=0). Which one of these activation functions would you recommend using for the output layer?


ReLU


Leaky ReLU


sigmoid


tanh

Correct
Yes. Sigmoid outputs a value between 0 and 1 which makes it a very good choice for binary classification. You can classify as 0 if the output is less than 0.5 and classify as 1 if the output is more than 0.5. It can be done with tanh as well but it is less convenient as the output is between -1 and 1.

5.Question 5
Consider the following code:


What will be B.shape? (If you’re not sure, feel free to run this in python to find out).


(, 3)


(4, 1)


(4, )


(1, 3)

Correct
Yes, we use (keepdims = True) to make sure that A.shape is (4,1) and not (4, ). It makes our code more rigorous.

6.Question 6
Suppose you have built a neural network. You decide to initialize the weights and biases to be zero. Which of the following statements is true?


Each neuron in the first hidden layer will perform the same computation. So even after multiple iterations of gradient descent each neuron in the layer will be computing the same thing as other neurons.


Each neuron in the first hidden layer will perform the same computation in the first iteration. But after one iteration of gradient descent they will learn to compute different things because we have “broken symmetry”.


Each neuron in the first hidden layer will compute the same thing, but neurons in different layers will compute different things, thus we have accomplished “symmetry breaking” as described in lecture.


The first hidden layer’s neurons will perform different computations from each other even in the first iteration; their parameters will thus keep evolving in their own way.

Correct

7.Question 7
Logistic regression’s weights w should be initialized randomly rather than to all zeros, because if you initialize to all zeros, then logistic regression will fail to learn a useful decision boundary because it will fail to “break symmetry”, True/False?


True


False

Correct
Yes, Logistic Regression doesn't have a hidden layer. If you initialize the weights to zeros, the first example x fed in the logistic regression will output zero but the derivatives of the Logistic Regression depend on the input x (because there's no hidden layer) which is not zero. So at the second iteration, the weights values follow x's distribution and are different from each other if x is not a constant vector.

8.Question 8
You have built a network using the tanh activation for all the hidden units. You initialize the weights to relative large values, using np.random.randn(..,..)*1000. What will happen?


This will cause the inputs of the tanh to also be very large, thus causing gradients to be close to zero. The optimization algorithm will thus become slow.


It doesn’t matter. So long as you initialize the weights randomly gradient descent is not affected by whether the weights are large or small.


This will cause the inputs of the tanh to also be very large, causing the units to be “highly activated” and thus speed up learning compared to if the weights had to start from small values.


This will cause the inputs of the tanh to also be very large, thus causing gradients to also become large. You therefore have to set \alphaα to be very small to prevent divergence; this will slow down learning.

Correct
Yes. tanh becomes flat for large values, this leads its gradient to be close to zero. This slows down the optimization algorithm.
