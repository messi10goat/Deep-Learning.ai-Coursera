1.Question 1
What does a neuron compute?


A neuron computes a linear function (z = Wx + b) followed by an activation function


A neuron computes a function g that scales the input x linearly (Wx + b)


A neuron computes the mean of all features before applying the output to an activation function


A neuron computes an activation function followed by a linear function (z = Wx + b)

Correct
Correct, we generally say that the output of a neuron is a = g(Wx + b) where g is the activation function (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, ...).

Correct
Correct, this is the logistic loss you've seen in lecture!

3.Question 3
Suppose img is a (32,32,3) array, representing a 32x32 image with 3 color channels red, green and blue. How do you reshape this into a column vector?


x = img.reshape((32*32*3,1))


x = img.reshape((32*32,3))


x = img.reshape((3,32*32))


x = img.reshape((1,32*32,*3))

4.Question 4
Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":


What will be the shape of "c"?


c.shape = (3, 2)


The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!


c.shape = (2, 1)


c.shape = (2, 3)

Correct
Yes! This is broadcasting. b (column vector) is copied 3 times so that it can be summed to each column of a.

5.Question 5
Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":


What will be the shape of "c"?


c.shape = (4, 3)


c.shape = (3, 3)


c.shape = (4,2)


The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!

Correct
Indeed! In numpy the "*" operator indicates element-wise multiplication. It is different from "np.dot()". If you would try "c = np.dot(a,b)" you would get c.shape = (4, 2).

7.Question 7
Recall that "np.dot(a,b)" performs a matrix multiplication on a and b, whereas "a*b" performs an element-wise multiplication.

Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":


What is the shape of c?


c.shape = (12288, 150)


c.shape = (12288, 45)


c.shape = (150,150)


The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!

Correct
Correct, remember that a np.dot(a, b) has shape (number of rows of a, number of columns of b). The sizes match because :

"number of columns of a = 150 = number of rows of b"

8.Question 8
Consider the following code snippet:


How do you vectorize this?


c = a + b


c = a.T + b.T


c = a + b.T


c = a.T + b

Correct
1 / 1 point
9.Question 9
Consider the following code:


What will be c? (If you’re not sure, feel free to run this in python to find out).


This will invoke broadcasting, so b is copied three times to become (3,3), and *∗ is an element-wise product so c.shape will be (3, 3)


This will invoke broadcasting, so b is copied three times to become (3, 3), and *∗ invokes a matrix multiplication operation of two 3x3 matrices so c.shape will be (3, 3)


This will multiply a 3x3 matrix a with a 3x1 vector, thus resulting in a 3x1 vector. That is, c.shape = (3,1).


It will lead to an error since you cannot use “*” to operate on these two matrices. You need to instead use np.dot(a,b)

Correct

10.Question 10
Consider the following computation graph.


What is the output J?


J = (c - 1)*(b + a)


J = (a - 1) * (b + c)


J = a*b + b*c + a*c


J = (b - 1) * (c + a)

Correct
Yes. J = u + v - w = a*b + a*c - (b + c) = a * (b + c) - (b + c) = (a - 1) * (b + c).
